> A space to share my journey through tech, projects, and ideas worth spreading.

Hi! I'm **Yash Bhoomkar**, an engineering student at Pune Institute of Computer Technology, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Minor in Data Science from IIT Madras.

My interests lie in exploring generative AI, system design, full-stack development, and building tools that solve real-world problems. From working on intelligent unit test case generators during my internship at **Capgemini GenAI**, to creating AI-driven marketing products and ML-powered sentiment analyzers — I’ve found joy in blending creativity with code.

This blog serves as my digital journal where I publish thoughts, lessons, and side-projects on topics that fascinate me. You’ll find:
- 👨‍💻 Deep dives into tech projects and ideas
- 🧠 Explanations of complex concepts made simple
- 🚀 Tutorials, tips, and quick installation guides
- 📚 Notes from personal study sessions and courses
- 🤝 Opportunities for collaboration

I’m always open to new ideas, contributions, and connecting with like-minded enthusiasts. If you’re into tech, open-source, or just curious — let’s chat!

Thanks for stopping by!  
— **Yash**
