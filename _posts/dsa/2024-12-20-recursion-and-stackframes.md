## 🧠 Introduction

Recursion is one of the most powerful — yet often misunderstood — concepts in computer science. It’s elegant, expressive, and frequently used in problems involving trees, graphs, backtracking, and more.

But what *really* happens under the hood when a function calls itself?

The answer lies in how **stack frames** work.

---

## 🔁 What is Recursion?

> A function that calls itself in order to solve a smaller version of a problem.

It has two main parts:
- **Base Case**: When to stop
- **Recursive Case**: When the function calls itself

📝 Example: Factorial  
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
Calling factorial(3) leads to:

matlab
Copy
Edit
factorial(3) → 3 * factorial(2)
              → 3 * (2 * factorial(1))
              → 3 * (2 * (1 * factorial(0)))
              → 3 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 6
🧱 The Role of Stack Frames
Every time a function is called — including recursive calls — it gets its own stack frame:

A stack frame contains:
Function parameters
Local variables
Return address
This stack is called the call stack.

🧮 Visualizing the Stack for factorial(3)
As the function calls build up:

Edit
TOP
factorial(3)
factorial(2)
factorial(1)
factorial(0)
BOTTOM
Each function waits for the next one to return a value.

Once the base case is hit (factorial(0)), the stack unwinds:

sql
Copy
Edit
factorial(0) returns 1
factorial(1) returns 1 * 1 = 1
factorial(2) returns 2 * 1 = 2
factorial(3) returns 3 * 2 = 6
⚠️ Why Stack Overflow Happens
If your recursion has no base case or goes too deep, the call stack runs out of space:

python
Copy
Edit
def infinite():
    return infinite()
❌ This results in a stack overflow error, because the system can't allocate any more stack frames.

💡 Tail Recursion Optimization (TCO)
Some languages (like Lisp, Scheme, or optimized C compilers) support Tail Call Optimization where tail-recursive functions reuse the same stack frame.

Python and Java do not support TCO.

📊 Iterative vs Recursive
Feature	Recursion	Iteration
Simpler logic	Often yes	Sometimes complex
Memory usage	Uses call stack	Uses loop variables
Speed	Can be slower	Usually faster
📘 Common Recursive Problems
Factorial, Fibonacci

Tree traversals (DFS)

Backtracking (N-Queens, Maze)

Divide and conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

🧠 Final Thoughts
Recursion is not magic — it’s just functions stacked on top of each other until a base case is hit.

Understanding the call stack is the key to mastering recursion. With that mental model, recursive problems become much easier to debug and optimize.
